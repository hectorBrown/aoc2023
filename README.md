# Solutions to AOC 2023

- Days are the directories `/1`, `/2`, `/3`, ..., `/25`.
- Data should be placed in `/[x]/data.txt` where `[x]` is any day number.
  - `/[x]/ex.txt` is the example data from the problem, sometimes `ex2.txt`, `ex3.txt` may also exist.
    - The parts for each day are stored in seperate files under `/[x]/p1.py`, and `/[x]/p2.py`.

## Solving with your data

- I recommend completing the problems yourself, there's not much point in solving them with my code.
- To find a solution, replace `/[x]/data.txt` with your data and run `python [x]/p[1/2].py`, which should output an answer.
  - Some solutions may take a while to run, if they do, there should be some form of output to indicate that the program is running correctly.

## Dependencies

 - `tqdm`
